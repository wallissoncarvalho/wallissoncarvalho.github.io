      <h1 class="post-title">Brazilian Gauged Precipitation Data</h1>
      <p> The Brazilian inventory provides a set with 11,976 stations that have measured daily data. If we filter the stations with data from June 2000 to the present,
            there will be only 1,412 stations.<br>
            In the interactive map following, you can see the stations around the country that have data from June 2000 to the present.
            When you put the mouse at a station, it is displayed the date of first measured data (First Date), the date of last measured data (End Date),
            the number of years with data (NYD), and missing data percentage between the start and the last date.
