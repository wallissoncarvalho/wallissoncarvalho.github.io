      <h1 class="post-title">Brazilian Gauged Precipitation Data</h1>
      <p> The Brazilian inventory provides a set with 11,976 stations that have measured daily data. If we filter the stations with data from June 2000 to the present,
            there will be only 6,394 stations.<br>
            In the interactive map following, you can see the stations around the country that have measured data between June 2000 and March 2020.
            If you move your cursor over a point, you can see some information about a station. Namely, the date of first measured data (Start Date),
            the date of last measured data (End Date), the number of years with measured data between June 2000 and March 2020 (NYD),
            and missing data percentage between the start and the last date.
